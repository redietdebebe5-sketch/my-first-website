    Hi, I am Rediet. Welcome to my little corner of thoughts and hobbies. Most of the time, when I am not in school, you'll find me lost in romance movies and novels or listening to music because music is my mood translator. Each song is a doorway to a new world full of emotions and stories that stay with me long after the credits roll. Books and movies are my escape and my inspiration, while music is my personal soundtrack â€” it carries emotions words often can't. These are just a few things that make my world feel colorful and full of life. Thanks for visiting my little corner!
